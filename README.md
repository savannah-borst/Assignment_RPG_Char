# RPG Characters \\ Java \\ Noroff Assignment
This is a console application. Within this application you are able to:
- create characters
- level them up
- create items
- equip items

Java  was used as a language. This was mandatory for the assignment

## How To Use
You would need a JDK(Java Development Kit) or an IDE that has built in JDK.
A IDE similar to IntelliJ is needed to run the code. Otherwise you could use a command line to compile all the files. But an IDE might be easier.

Run Main.java in the src folder 
There is also a test folder which you could run.

## Future Work
Future work may include
- Getting input from users and using this to make a character

## Built With
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
